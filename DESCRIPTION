Description: Use Random Forest (RF) classification trees to assign whale injuries
    as 'Serious' or 'Non-Serious', based on narratives. There are two RF models, 
    one for vessel strikes (ModelVessel) and one for entanglements (ModelEntangle).
    Covariates are generated directly from narratives, by coding presence / absence
    of key words / phrases (i.e. 'healthy' vs 'emaciated') associated with known serious
    and non-serious injury cases. Models are based on 'known-outcome' cases, e.g. 
    recoveries documented >=1 yr after a vessel strike or entanglement, observed health 
    declines or serious injuries at any point after an incident, and deaths. Models are 
    then applied to 'unknown outcome' cases, where injury severity and risk to whales are 
    unknown due to a lack of details and/or brief observation periods. See 'SeriousInjuryTutorial()'.
