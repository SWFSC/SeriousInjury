ATL,6-Jan-08,A report was received regarding an entangled humpback whale was initially observed by a recreational fisherman. The fisherman reported that the whale had a severe flipper entanglement on the right flipper and a lot of trailing net. He approached the animal and removed the wad of netting trailing behind the animal but it sank immediately.  Responders on-site reported that the entanglement on the right flipper appears severe and is cutting through approximately 50% of the flipper with some line trailing back to just in front of the flukes. Multiple attempts to get close enough to cut any of the entangling lines were unsuccessful before daylight faded. Emaciated with cyamids.,EN,SI,Decline,-,0,M,L2,L2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Netting,1
