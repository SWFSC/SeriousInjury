Appeared to be anchored and was unable to move. There were approximately 12 body wraps on the whale. CWRT, DFO and GMWSRS responded. A search was conducted in the area, however, the whale was not spotted. The whale was re-sighted late in the afternoon by the Grand Manan ferry. Unfortunately, weather conditions and diminishing daylight prevented a response. The following day, November 14, while hauling his gear, a fisherman found the entangled humpback. After an initial active response to the approaching fishing vessel, the whale seemed too exhausted to move much. A GMWSRS member on board the fishing vessel was able to remove approximately 12 body wraps from the whale. Following a visual inspection, it appeared that the entangling gear had been removed successfully. Visible injuries were limited to numerous abrasions, one of which was deep enough to cut through the skin, and a possible injured left pectoral fin. Although it was observed to move freely, the left pectoral fin was generally kept in an abnormal position, being tucked up against the body. Following the disentanglement, the whale swam away quite slowly.","EN","NS","Unknown","Disentangled",0,"F","L2","L2",NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,"Pot/Trap","-","HUWH",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,"VSpdUnk","VSzUnk",0,0
